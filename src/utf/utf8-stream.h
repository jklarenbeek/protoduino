/**
 * @brief Reads a UTF-8 encoded character from the stream and decodes it into a Unicode rune.
 *
 * This function reads a UTF-8 encoded character from the specified stream and decodes it into a Unicode rune.
 * It examines the byte sequence of the UTF-8 character to determine its length and performs the decoding
 * to obtain the corresponding Unicode rune. The decoded rune is stored in the provided pointer.
 *
 * @param st   Pointer to the stream from which to read the UTF-8 character.
 * @param rune Pointer to a variable where the decoded Unicode rune will be stored.
 *
 * @return Returns the number of bytes read from the stream if successful. If the stream has no available bytes,
 *         it returns 0. If the UTF-8 sequence is corrupted or incomplete, it returns a specific error code
 *         (negative value) defined in the implementation.
 *
 *         - `UTF8_RET_CORRUPT`: Returned when the UTF-8 sequence is corrupted.
 *         - `UTF8_RET_OVERFLOW`: Returned when the UTF-8 sequence represents a four-character sequence,
 *           which cannot be implemented due to the rune being 16 bits wide.
 *         - `UTF8_RET_INCOMPLETE`: Returned when the UTF-8 sequence is incomplete and more bytes are required.
